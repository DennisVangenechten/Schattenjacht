This project is a JavaScript-based grid game where the player controls a hunter on a game board. The goal is to collect all the treasures while avoiding enemies that move around the board. The game features three difficulty levels—easy, normal, and hard—that affect the number of treasures, walls, and enemies, as well as the behavior of the enemies.

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive UI where players can move the hunter using buttons or arrow keys. Enemies move on their own every second, and the player must avoid them while collecting treasures. The game ends when either all treasures are collected (win condition) or the hunter loses all lives (lose condition).

Features
Dynamic Board: A customizable grid where walls, treasures, and enemies are placed randomly.
Hunter Movement: Controlled by buttons or arrow keys, the hunter can move up, down, left, and right, avoiding walls and enemies.
Enemies: Different enemy movement patterns (random, towards the hunter, patrolling) based on the selected difficulty.
Game Mechanics: The game is won by collecting all treasures and lost when the hunter's lives reach zero.
Difficulty Levels:
Easy: Fewer enemies and treasures.
Normal: Enemies double after treasure collection.
Hard: Enemies triple after treasure collection.
